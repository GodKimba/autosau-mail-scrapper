Solutions for getting emails from autosau:

- Create a filter for the autosau@puc-rio.br and then list it







Obs:

service.users() # Is to go to the users inbox

service.users().list() # After getting into the users inbox you can call the list/filters/get/labels methods from gmail api

service.users().list().execute() # You need to write the execute method after all the specification.


The q parameter uses the gmail way of filtering: from:autosau@puc-rio.br as an example.
